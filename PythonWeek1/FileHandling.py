#File handling refers to the process of creating, opening, reading, writing, and deleting files using Python
#Python has built-in functions and methods to make this easy

#Important to know for data persistence and processing
#automation of many real-world tasks
#handling large data sets

#open() is the key function and takes 2 parameters; filename and mode
#4 modes available:
#"r" - read; the default mode for reading; throws an error if file does not exist
#"a" - append; creates a file if it does not exist
#"w" - write; creates a new file if it does not exist
#"x" - create; returns an error if file does not exist

#We can also specify if the file should be handled as binary or text using "b" and "t" respectively



#myFile = open('./resources/my-file.txt', "w")

#print(x.read())
#y = open("myOtherFile.txt", "rt")
